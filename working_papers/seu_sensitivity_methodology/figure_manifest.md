# Per-Figure Manifest

Provenance for every figure and table in the paper, so each headline artifact is
reproducible from a pinned commit. Build this **as figures are produced**, not as
a post-draft cleanup — it requires touching every figure in §§4, 6, 7 to record
provenance and is easy to defer and never finish.

This manifest is a **precondition for the first full-paper draft** (plan
Appendix E.2).

> **Embedding status (2026-07-01):** the six headline figures above are now
> embedded in the paper body via Quarto `@fig-` cross-references (Figures 1–6),
> for the pre-arXiv review round. The two SVG-only foundational figures (§4.3
> scatter, §6.5 δ ECDF) were converted to PDF with `rsvg-convert`; the other
> four ship as committed PNGs in `figures/`. §4.4 keeps the m_0 SBC result in
> prose (no separate m_0-only artifact); the embedded δ ECDF (Figure 3, §6.5)
> carries the marginal-SBC demarcation for both models.

> The two foundational-report figures (§4.3, §6.5) are driven by the
> canonical design constants fixed **in-script** in
> `reports/foundations/04_parameter_recovery.qmd` and `06_sbc_validation.qmd`
> (via the generic `parameter_recovery.py` / `sbc.py` drivers), not by the
> smoke-scale `configs/*recovery*.json` / `configs/*sbc*.json` files — so their
> Config column records the inline canonical design rather than a JSON path.
>
> The §1.8 dependency chain is an **authored** LaTeX `\underbrace` display in the
> body (not a generated figure, not mermaid). The §7.5.5 forest plot
> (`report_2x2_forest.png`) renders the canonical report-level per-cell slope
> summaries (claims_ledger C9/C10/C12/C13), so it agrees with @tbl-2x2 by
> construction; it is a deterministic render with no RNG. The spike also records
> a population-OLS cross-check (`b_i = Cov(T,α_i)/Var(T)` over the committed
> per-condition draws) in its results JSON — diagnostic only, not plotted: it
> reproduces the Ellsberg cells and gives smaller-magnitude insurance medians at
> identical `P(slope<0)`, the same convention difference documented in C16.
