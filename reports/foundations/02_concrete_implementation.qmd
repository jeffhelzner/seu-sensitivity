## Overview

*This report is under development.*

This report will cover:

1. **Stan Model Structure**: The three model files (m_0.stan, m_0_sim.stan, m_0_sbc.stan)
2. **Parameterization**: How features map to subjective probabilities via β
3. **Utility Construction**: The ordered utility vector with Dirichlet increments
4. **Likelihood**: The softmax choice likelihood
5. **Generated Quantities**: Posterior predictions and log-likelihoods
