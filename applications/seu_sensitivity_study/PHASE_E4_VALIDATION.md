# Phase E4: Go/No-Go Validation

Date: 2026-09-06

## Frozen-design checks

The explicit production configuration validates with 36 cells across venture
and hiring, 140 menus per pool, two presentations, and 10,080 expected choice
calls. The zero-cost pipeline dry run independently reports 5,040 calls per
pool and 280 observations per cell.

Both retained pools pass under the frozen embedding-axis thresholds and
variant-D recipes:

| Pool | Gate | Worst cross-size eta-gap difference | Cross-pool difference | Threshold |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Venture | pass | 0.0906 | 0.0601 | 0.25 |
| Hiring | pass | 0.0484 | 0.0601 | 0.25 |

The first E4 validation attempt reported a false venture failure because the
pool-major runner compared venture's new report to hiring's stale pre-freeze
report. Hiring then compared against venture's new report and passed. The
runner now completes every selected pool through validation, refreshes all
selected validation reports after sibling reports are current, and only then
runs later phases. A regression test locks this ordering. With that fix, both
reports independently contain the same 0.0601 cross-pool difference and pass.

The full application test suite passes with 460 tests.

## Batch and usage-persistence gate

The approved production mode is provider Batch collection with a $31 ceiling.
The frozen configuration now selects `collection_mode: batch`; other configs
retain the synchronous default. Choice collection supports both OpenAI JSONL
file batches and Anthropic Message Batches. Each cell has an atomic state file
containing its provider batch ID and a digest of the full request set. A first
invocation submits once and returns `batch_pending`; later invocations retrieve
that same batch. Prompt or model drift after submission is rejected rather than
silently attaching old paid results to a changed design.

Results are joined through deterministic `custom_id` values, never provider
output order. Terminal batch failures, per-request failures, incomplete result
sets, and unexpected result IDs stop collection explicitly. Successful results
flow through the same choice parser, presentation-order resolution, schema
validation, and checkpoint format as synchronous results.

Usage is written to `usage_events.jsonl` before each final assessment or choice
artifact is published. Events have deterministic IDs, are append-only and
idempotent on resume, and are flushed with `fsync`. Batch events retain input,
output, cached-input, reasoning, cache-creation, and cache-read token fields
when exposed by the provider, plus the provider, model, request count, Batch
discount, and estimated cost. Later phase summaries cannot overwrite them.

Mocked contract tests cover submit/resume behavior, request-digest mismatch,
OpenAI request JSONL, Anthropic extended-thinking request parameters,
out-of-order results, incomplete output, usage aggregation, collector
presentation mapping, and preservation of the synchronous path.

## Live provider Batch probe

On 2026-09-07, a paid probe submitted two 64-token-capped choice requests to
each provider's cheapest configured production endpoint. Both initial calls
returned pending provider batch IDs. Later invocations resumed those IDs rather
than resubmitting requests, and both providers reached their successful terminal
state. Each provider returned the requested `ANSWER: 1` and `ANSWER: 2` values
under the correct custom IDs.

| Provider | Endpoint | Calls | Input tokens | Output tokens | Recorded Batch cost |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| OpenAI | `gpt-4o-mini` | 2 | 82 | 8 | $0.00000855 |
| Anthropic | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | 2 | 74 | 16 | $0.00007700 |
| **Total** | | **4** | **156** | **24** | **$0.00008555** |

The provider state files contain the terminal statuses and usage summaries;
the append-only ledger contains exactly one matching event per provider. No
cached-input, cache-creation, cache-read, or reasoning tokens were reported for
these non-reasoning probe arms. The measured total was below the authorized $1
probe ceiling.

## Verdict

**GO at the Phase E4 technical gate.** The scientific design, frozen gates,
offline call count, Batch implementation, immutable usage persistence,
application tests, and live provider-specific Batch probe all pass.

This verdict does not itself authorize production spending. Production choice
collection remains stopped until the user explicitly authorizes the frozen
10,080-call Batch run under the $31 ceiling.

The synchronous path is technically validated, but using it would invoke the
$61 fallback and also requires separate approval. No production calls have
been launched.
