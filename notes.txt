1. start testing from the start of the project. everything should be working at this point. clean up all file-level documentation along the way.
2. remove any legacy structure.
3. i think we do need some sort of sample size analysis module, similar to what we had before.
4. our second application should look at a single llm across multiple parameter settings, e.g., changing temp.
