## Overview

*This report is under development.*

This report will cover:

1. **Recovery Design**: Simulation-recovery methodology
2. **Bias and RMSE**: Assessment of estimation accuracy
3. **Coverage**: 95% credible interval coverage rates
4. **Credible Interval Width**: Precision of estimates
5. **Visualization**: True vs. estimated parameter plots
