Checking sampler transitions treedepth.
Treedepth satisfactory for all transitions.

Checking sampler transitions for divergences.
2 of 4000 (0.05%) transitions ended with a divergence.
These divergent transitions indicate that HMC is not fully able to explore the posterior distribution.
Try increasing adapt delta closer to 1.
If this doesn't remove all divergences, try to reparameterize the model.

Checking E-BFMI - sampler transitions HMC potential energy.
E-BFMI satisfactory.

Rank-normalized split effective sample size satisfactory for all parameters.

Rank-normalized split R-hat values satisfactory for all parameters.

Processing complete.
