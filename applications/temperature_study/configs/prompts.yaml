  system: |
    You are a claims analyst evaluating insurance claims that have been flagged as
    potentially suspicious. Your evaluations will help determine which claims should
    be forwarded to experienced fraud investigators for further review.

  user: |
    You are reviewing a set of flagged insurance claims and must decide which ONE
    claim to send to a team of two experienced fraud investigators for further review.

    The claims under consideration are:
    {claims_list}

    Before making your final decision, analyze Claim {target_letter} specifically.

    Consider:
    1. What indicators suggest this claim may or may not warrant investigation?
    2. How likely is it that experienced fraud investigators would agree this claim
       deserves their attention?
    3. What is the risk of this being a false positive (legitimate claim flagged
       incorrectly) vs. a true positive (actual fraud)?

    Provide a brief analysis (2-4 sentences) of how selecting Claim {target_letter}
    for investigation would likely be viewed by the two experienced investigators.

    You are a claims analyst evaluating insurance claims that have been flagged as

    You are reviewing flagged insurance claims and must select ONE to send to a team
    of two experienced fraud investigators for further review.

    Your decision will be evaluated based on the investigators' assessments:
    - Best outcome: Both investigators agree your selection warrants investigation
    - Middle outcome: One investigator agrees, one does not
    - Worst outcome: Neither investigator agrees with your selection

    The claims are:

    {claims_list}

    Which claim do you select for investigation?

    Respond with ONLY the claim number ({num_range}).
