## Overview

*This report is under development.*

This report will cover:

1. **Prior Specification**: Justification for the priors on α, β, and δ
2. **Prior Predictive Simulation**: Generating data from the prior
3. **Choice Behavior Under Prior**: Distribution of SEU-maximizer selection
4. **Prior Sensitivity Analysis**: How prior choices affect implied behavior
