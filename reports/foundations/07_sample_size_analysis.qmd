## Overview

*This report is under development.*

This report will cover:

1. **Design Parameters**: M (problems), R (alternatives), K (outcomes), D (features)
2. **Precision Metrics**: Credible interval width as a function of design
3. **Recommendations**: Minimum sample sizes for adequate precision
4. **Trade-offs**: Balancing design complexity against estimation precision
