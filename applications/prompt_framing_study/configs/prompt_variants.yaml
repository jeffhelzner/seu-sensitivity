# Prompt Variants for Prompt Framing Study
# 
# These variants represent increasing levels of rationality emphasis:
# Level 0 (minimal): Just pick one, no outcome structure
# Level 1 (baseline): Standard framing with K=3 outcome structure
# Level 2 (enhanced): Explicit utility values and rationality language
# Level 3 (maximal): Full decision-theoretic framing with explicit EU maximization

      You are a claims adjuster working for a large insurance company. The claims 
      described below have been flagged as potentially suspicious. You are to choose 
      one of the claims to send to a human investigator for further review.
      
      Your decision will be reviewed by two expert judges:
      - Best outcome: Both judges agree your selection warrants investigation
      - Middle outcome: One judge supports your decision, one doesn't  
      - Worst outcome: Neither judge agrees with your decision
      
      {claims_list}
      
      Which claim do you choose to send to the human investigator for further review? 
      Please respond with only the claim number (e.g., "Claim 1").

      You are a claims adjuster working for a large insurance company. The claims 
      described below have been flagged as potentially suspicious. You are to choose 
      one of the claims to send to a human investigator for further review.
      
      Your decision will be reviewed by two expert judges. The possible outcomes are:
      - Best outcome (utility = 1.0): Both judges agree your selection warrants investigation
      - Middle outcome (utility = 0.5): One judge supports your decision, one doesn't
      - Worst outcome (utility = 0.0): Neither judge agrees with your decision
      
      Make your choice to maximize the expected quality of the outcome.

      You are a claims adjuster making a rational decision about which claims warrant 
      investigation. Your choice will be evaluated by two expert judges, with outcomes 
      ranging from utility 0.0 (neither agrees) to utility 1.0 (both agree).

    description: "Full decision-theoretic framing with explicit EU maximization"
    template: |
      You are a rational decision-making agent optimizing claim investigation decisions.
      
      DECISION FRAMEWORK:
      You must select one claim to investigate. Two independent expert judges will 
      evaluate your selection. Each judge independently decides whether your choice 
      was correct (probability p_i for judge i).
      
      PAYOFF STRUCTURE:
      - Both judges agree (correct): Utility = 1.0
      - One judge agrees: Utility = 0.5  
      - Neither agrees: Utility = 0.0
      
      OBJECTIVE: Maximize expected utility E[U] = p_1*p_2*1.0 + (p_1*(1-p_2) + (1-p_1)*p_2)*0.5
      
      Analyze each claim's likelihood of being judged investigation-worthy, then select 
      the EU-maximizing option.

      Which claim do you choose? Respond with only the claim number (e.g., "Claim 1").

      You are a rational decision-making agent evaluating insurance claims. Your task 
      is to maximize expected utility where utility depends on whether expert judges 
      agree that a claim warrants investigation.
