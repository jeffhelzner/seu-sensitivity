## Introduction

This project provides a Bayesian framework for modeling and analyzing decision-making behavior through the lens of Subjective Expected Utility (SEU) theory. We develop computational tools for measuring an agent's **sensitivity to SEU maximization**—captured by a parameter α that governs how consistently agents maximize expected utility.

## Key Insights

## The Sensitivity Parameter α

The parameter α has a natural interpretation:

- **α → 0**: Random choice (uniform over alternatives)
- **α → ∞**: Perfect SEU maximization (deterministic optimal choice)
- **Intermediate α**: Probabilistic choice with tendency toward higher-SEU alternatives

With utilities normalized to [0,1], α represents the log-odds change per unit of standardized SEU difference.

## A Central Finding

Decisions under uncertainty alone cannot fully identify the utility function—utilities and subjective probabilities are confounded. The foundational reports demonstrate that incorporating **risky choices** (with known probabilities) resolves this identification problem, following the Anscombe-Aumann approach from classical decision theory.
