## Overview

*This report is under development.*

This report will cover:

1. **Motivation**: Why combine risky and uncertain choice?
2. **Model Specification**: The m_1 likelihood with both choice types
3. **Identification Benefits**: Separation of utility and probability
4. **Comparison with m_0**: What m_1 identifies that m_0 cannot
